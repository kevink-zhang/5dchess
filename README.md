A real-time multi-player 5d-chess app using node, express, and of course socket.io.

Go to 5dchess.glitch.me to play the application. The site may take some time to initially load. You can create a game on the left, or join an existing game with a code on the right. Once in the game, players take turn making moves by clicking and dragging, with controls for moving pieces and options for undoing, surrendering, and ending turns.
